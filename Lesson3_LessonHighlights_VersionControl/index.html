            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Do you ever wonder why and how it’s possible that multiple can edit a file at the same time? Version control acts as a main repository, a database storing the files, for all project files so that the file sharing problem could be solved. The version control server allows multiple people to check out files, make the changes they want to make, and then check them back into the server. If you are someone that is always worried about their files getting lost, Version Control would be highly recommended. With Version Control, you can easily recover files you once lost.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Version Control System</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The version control system tracks information about files including who changed the files, when that file was changed, what has changed about that file, and most importantly updates the files to merge all the information that has been changed by multiple people. Version control systems are important in order to avoid chaos and does so by backing up and restoring each file, track each change, track ownership, etc. What’s awesome about a VCS is that old files are not lost forever. If needed, one can go back to an older version of that file at any time. If it weren't for the VCS, files could easily get lost and the chances of someone having to start a school project or essay over are huge.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free and open source VCS that handles projects in an efficient way. With a day of experience being a student in LIS2360, Git seems easy to use and learn. Git works on a local repository so the individual obtains a copy of the data stored in their machine. Other than a remote repository, Git files have no chance in being overwritten because they are not shared with multiple people. Git works with a number of commands that helps one accomplish the operation he or she is trying to complete. Git init helps you create new repositories, git add adds file changes to your index, and git status shows you the status of the files in the index. These are just a few of the commands that help contribute to the speedy process.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">It’s important to be able to know how to properly manage your remote repository in order to work on any Git assignment. Let me further explain what a remote repository is! A repository is a database, but a remote repository is a database that is NOT your own. This database that contains files could be one that’s on another network or even the internet. In order to be able to work on a Git assignment, you need to know how to add remote repositories, remove remote repositories, manage them, and even clone them. One may come across a problem, just like I did, that shows an “error” message when adding a remote repository. The way you can see which remote repositories you have on the server, you can run the git remote command and it’ll list the remotes. There are many other commands involving remotes that one would have to learn and look over when working with Git.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Different from a remote repository, a local repository refers to a clone of your OWN database and installation.  The Git local repository is the one in which one will make local changes. In a local repository, there are three different areas. One is the working directory which holds the actual files. The second is the index which is simply just the staging area and the third is the head which is involved with the last commit you've made (the submitted change you've made). There are certain commands involved with proposing changes through a local repository such as git add and git commit, which submits that specific change. To update your local repository, you use the command git pull. The way remote and local repositories interact is when they merge together. In this case, if you are on a local repository and want to merge with a remote repository, you use the command git merge.</p>
